# Twitter-Sentiments
This repository provides a detailed review and model to review the sentiments of twitter. The dataset helps differentiate between racial/sexist and non-racial/sexist tweets.

In the data, full tweet texts are provided with their labels for training data. The label '1' represents that the tweet is racist/sexist whereas label '0' refers to the tweet as non-racist/sexist. 

Our objective is to create a model which can predict these labels with high accuracy.
